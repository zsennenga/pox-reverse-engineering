# Pox Reverse Engineering

A set of tools and models to interact with P-O-X devices, a handheld game from 2001 by Hasbro.

This project encompasses the primary wireless message - that is, advertising P-O-X units for multiplayer combat.

Super lazy implementation - please forgive the string-based manchester decoding, it was much easier than working with bytes objects when doing analysis and it just sorta stuck around.
